In the DIY project I made a car backup sensor. I used a rangefinder which would detect the distance, and if the distance is less than 25 cm, it will make a noise and the LCD display will display “Object near”. A red LED will also turn on. Otherwise, if the rangefinder does not detect an object within 25 cm, then it will have a green LED on always, and the LCD will display “No object near”. One thing that I did well on the project was the coding part, because I found it simple. A thing that I could improve on is the plating, because I just used a cardboard box. Maybe I could have 3D printed something.
